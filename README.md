# surface-studio
A GeoJSON based web application to manipulate and compare surfaces

#### Project Steps

- [x] Add initial react app (monday)
- [x] Host the initial app, update the readme and have a working pipeline (tuesday)
- [x] Start the core features
  - [x] Add the layout (~~tuesday~~) (late delivery, done on wednesday, adjusting timeframe for next items)
  - [x] Add the json files, read them, start adding initial application state and render polygons ~~basic event handlers~~ (~~wednesday~~ ~~thursday~~) (Had help wife and forgot about it so got late on the project, delivered on Sunday very early)
  
  >__*NOTE*__: I have lost a lot of time during saturday night trying to catch-up with time and rushing ahead with google maps without giving it too much thought, this was a mistake, it ended up being much easier to work with polygons with mapbox instead and made me lose probably 5 to 6 hours reading through google maps documentation.
  - [ ]  Add event handlers
    - [ ] Select a polygon, should be able to edit polygon shape
    - [ ] Multiselection, should deactivate polygon modification
    - [ ] Calculate selected area
  - [ ] Implement polygon operation: union and intersect
